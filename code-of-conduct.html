            <h1> Hackathing Code of Conduct</h1>
            
            <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at Hackathing are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>
            
            <h2>Need Help?</h2>
            
            <p>You can contact any member of the Hackathing Team at any time during the event if you need help. If you have any questions or concerns before the event, you can reach out to Jessica or Dominique:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Jessica Thomas: jess.rae.thomas@gmail.com </li>
                <li> Dominique Charlebois: domo.charlebois@gmail.com</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
            
            <p>The Hackathing Team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackathon experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form.</p>
            
            <p>Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any hackathon venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Hackathing participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.</p>

            <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            
            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
            
            <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
            
            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.</p>
            
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Hackathing Team immediately.</p>
            
            <p>The Hackathing Team will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.</p>
            
            <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the hackathon venue and hackathon-related social events.</p>
